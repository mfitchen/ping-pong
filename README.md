# _Ping Pong_

#### _Epicodus: Intro To Programming (Week 3 Solo Project), June 10, 2016_

#### By _**Marty Fitchen**_

## Description

_This is an Epicodus student solo project creating a web page that uses front-end user interface logic to gather an input (in this case a number >= 1) and convert it to a list (using back-end logic). Using Behavior Driven Development (BDD) this list will establish true and false booleans based on expected outputs based on potential user inputs using just the right amount of clean code. See spec below:_

Behavior  | Input Example | Output Example
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Output can count up to provided number.  | 2  | [1,2]
Output can replace numbers divisible by 3 with "ping".  | 3  | [1,2,ping]
Output can replace numbers divisible by 5 with "pong".  | 5  | [1,2,ping,4,pong]
Output can replace numbers divisible by 15 with "pingpong".  | 15  | [1,2,ping,4,pong,ping,7,8,9,pong,11,ping,13,14,pingpong]
